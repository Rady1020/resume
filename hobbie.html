            Hello dear !My name Rady Ren. I am 27 years old. I am from Cambodia and my native languages is Khmer. 
            I graduated a bachelor’s engineering degree in Computer Science in 2017. I used to work as cyber security officer in Cambodia. 
            I have been in U.S.A a year three months. I live in Portland with my parents and my older sister. 
            My hobbies listen to music and cooking. I love a lot of kind of food especially spicy food. 
            Currently, I am working as Machine operator and studying part time English at PCC.
             I want to well communicate with everyone around the world and have good English ability get IT career. 
             My challenges in speaking English are pronunciation and action of speak and speak with correct grammar. 
             Moreover, it’s really difficult for me to listen to somebody speaking fast. 
             It’s easy to speak English I think I can speak basic word and with body languages to make partner understand and speak slower. 
             I hope to speak with better pronunciation and good communicate with everyone.
